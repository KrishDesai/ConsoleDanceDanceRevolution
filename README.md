# ConsoleDanceDanceRevolution
Dance Dance Revolution is a popular 1990s game where players stand on a dance platform and hit coloured arrows to musical and visual cues. In this project, I created a Dance Dance Revolution game that can played on the console with just a keyboard. 

**üéÆ Game:*
At first, the game will ask the user for how many rounds they would like to play. After which, they will be prompted to enter the desired amount of moves in the round. 

The user has to match the icon output by inputting the correct text associated with the icon. If the user inputs the correct text, they received the full point. If the user inputs a answer with the correct answer contained in it (ex. "righting" for "right"), they received half a point. 

Currently, the game has 5 possible actions:
‚¨ÜÔ∏è: UP
‚û°Ô∏è: RIGHT
‚¨áÔ∏è: DOWN
‚¨ÖÔ∏è: LEFT
‚è´: JUMP

At the end, the score for each round alongside the overall score is displayed.
